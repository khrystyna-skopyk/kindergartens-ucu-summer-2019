# kindergartens-ucu-summer-2019

This repo contains our work for the project we did on [UCU DS Summer School](https://apps.ucu.edu.ua/en/summerschool/). 

The problem definition for the project can be found [here](How and where to build new kindergartens in Lviv.pptx).

All the data for the project was provided to us by Lviv City Counsil. Since it contains some sensititve information, we cannot, unfortunately, share it here. 

The presentation of our completed project can be found [here](Forecasting the creation of additional groups in kindergartens in Lviv.pdf).
